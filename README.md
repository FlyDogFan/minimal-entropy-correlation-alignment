# Minimal-Entropy Correlation Alignment for Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation


## Code
Each sub-folder (*...in progress...*) is named after the dataset analyzed and equipped with its own README. The provided code runs with Python 2.7 (should run with Python 3 as well, not tested). For the installation of ``tensorflow-gpu`` please refer to the [website](http://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

The following command should install the main dependencies on most Linux (Ubuntu) machines

``
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip &&
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
``
